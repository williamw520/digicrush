* Development setup
** Dependent libraries and packages defined in package.json.
** Use gulp for build.  See the exports in gulpfile.js for available commands.
** Gulp commands
*** gulp
    Clean the project and build the whole app from scratch.
*** gulp build
    Build the complete app.
*** gulp clean
    Remove intermediate files
*** gulp gen
    Compile the shader files and generate their JS versions.  Generate model object files.
*** gulp genw
    Watch shader source and model data source files and regenerate them on the fly.
*** gulp glslify
    For generating the JS module files for the shaders from the .glsl files.  Other JS files import the shaders as JS modules.
*** gulp liveserver
    This runs a HTTP server off from the src directory, not using build or dist content at all.
*** gulp buildserver, gulp distserver
    Runs runs a HTTP server off from the build directory, or from the dist/digicrush directory, for checking the final build.
** Directories
*** The 'build' directory is for staging files.
*** The 'dist' directory has the final distribution package.
*** src/index.html is the main entry point for the app.
*** src/test.html is the main entry point for running tests.
*** src/js is the Javascript directory.
*** src/shader is the shader source code directory.
*** data/ is the model data directory.

* Story
  Billions of digital currency are being siphoned off.
  Stop the transfer of digits before it's too late.
  Put a 404 on the flow of the digital theft.

* Game Design
** Mechanics
*** A stream of digits, of 1-6, moving from right to left across a chasm.
*** More random digits are sent from right as time passes.
*** As the story goes, it's building a digital pathway to transfer digital currency.
*** When the digits reach the left side, a bolt of high voltage zaps through.
*** CANCELED Pressing 1-9 keys or touching the 1-9 keypad triggers a digit match attempt.
    Too many controls/choices; reduce choices for player.
*** Pressing 1-6 keys, UIO/JKL keys, or touching the 1-6 UI keypad triggers a digit match..
*** A single matched digit has no effect.  Flash digit matched for feedback.
*** When more than one digit of the number matched, the matching digits are eliminated.
*** After elimination, the remaining digits snap back together to the right.
*** When there're gaps in the stream, enters the snapback mode.
*** During snapback if consecutive digits matched, a new round of elimination starts.
*** A 2-digit elimination scores 1x.  3-digit elimination scores 2x.  4-digit scores 4x.
*** Score-multiplier = (|digits| - 2) ^ 2.
*** Release $ sign when scored.  Number of $ = score-multiplier X 2.
*** Non-digit blocks can be sprinkled in the stream, which cannot be digit matched.
*** The blocks can be eliminated when 3 or more of them are lined up consecutively.
** Power blocks.
*** Elimination of consecutive digits or blocks generates a power block.
*** Consecutive of 3 digits of (1-3) creates a wildcard block, matching any digit.
    Wildcard adds 1 digit to any other matching digits, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 1+3=4 mached.
*** Consecutive of 3 digits of (4-6) creates a bomb block with a random digit label.
    Match the digit bomb to trigger the bomb.  Wildcard can match it.
    Bomb eliminates 3 neighboring digits.  Snapback mode starts after bomb.
*** Consecutive of 4 non-digit blocks creates a super-bomb, with a random digit label.
    Super-bomb eliminates 6 neighboring digits.
** Digit Preview
*** On the right side, dimmed digits are hovering/dancing nervously in the background.
*** The pending digit drops through a vertical tube on the right side.
*** The digit drops to the horizontal pathway, and starts marching to the left.
