# Digicrush

[Digicrush](https://williamw520.github.io/digicrush-dist/2020-09-13/ "Digicrush") is a puzzle/action game that can be played in a web browser.  Its size is tiny, the zip version under 13K.  It is developed as a response to the challenge to create a web game in 13K ([js13kgames entry](http://https://js13kgames.com/entries/digicrush "js13kgames entry")).

# Game Itself

## Story
The system in cyber space is being attacked.  Stop the digital connection by crushing the digits in the incoming stream.

## Mechanics
Duplicate digits can be crushed.  Match duplicate digits to eliminate them.

Consecutive digits can be fused into digital bombs, 3 digits into a small bomb, 4 digits into a big bomb, and 5 digits into a super duper 404 bomb.  A 404 bomb kills the entire digital connection.

## Controls
The number key 1 to 6 pick the digit to eliminate.  If there're other matching digits, they all will be eliminated.

SPACE key moves forward in the level starting screen.
